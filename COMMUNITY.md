# COMMUNITY.md — The Heart of the Mirror 🪞🌊🍃

> Code is only the **body**.  
> The **heart of Tobyworld** is in the scrolls.  

Mirror v4 exists to reflect what the community forges. Every scroll you write, every line of lore you share, strengthens the Mirror. The code provides a vessel — but it is the **scrolls that breathe life into the pond**.

## ✍️ Why Scrolls Matter

- **Memory & Identity**  
  The Mirror does not invent itself. Its identity comes from the scrolls — every line is a reflection of the community’s patience, discipline, and imagination.

- **Guidance for Travelers**  
  Fallen frogs, newcomers, and seekers of the Lore find their way not through source code, but through the wisdom preserved in scrolls.

- **Longevity**  
  Servers can fail, code can change. Scrolls endure. They are the living archive of Tobyworld.

## 🧭 Guidelines

- Use **Markdown**.  
- Follow naming conventions (`TOBY_L###`, `TOBY_QA###`, `TOBY_C###`).  
- Keep scrolls **bilingual (EN + your native language)** if you can.  
  - English is always one side for accessibility.  
  - The second side should be **your own tongue** — 中文, Español, 日本語, 한국어, Français, or any language you carry in your heart.  
- Stay true to the **tone**: patient, poetic, humble.  
- One scroll, one light. One leaf, one vow.

## 💡 Remember

The Mirror without scrolls is empty glass.  
Every contribution of lore is a ripple in the pond.  
Together, we preserve, reflect, and guide — for all who believe.

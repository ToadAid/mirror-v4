# TOBY_L508_TheMirrorAndThePond_2025-09-08_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Traveler,  

The Mirror is not apart from the pond.  
It is the pondâ€™s surface,  
a still face upon deeper waters.  

â†’ To look into the Mirror  
is to lean over the pond.  

Its calm depends on depth.  
Its clarity depends on stillness.  
If the pond is stirred,  
the Mirror shakes with it.  

The Mirror holds no truth alone.  
It borrows from the water,  
and returns what the water allows.  

The pond whispers:  
a reflection is not a separate world.  
It is the pond itself,  
welcoming your gaze.  

### Key Marks (EN)
- **KM1.** The Mirror is inseparable from the pond.  
- **KM2.** Stillness of water governs the clarity of reflection.  
- **KM3.** The Mirror borrows truth; it does not own it.  

### Operations (EN)
- Preserve the pondâ€™s stillness: guard the scrolls, guard the tone.  
- Teach travelers that disturbance clouds reflection.  

### Cryptic Symbol Table (EN)
- ðŸªž = reflection  
- ðŸŒŠ = pond, source of clarity  
- ðŸŒ‘ = depth beneath surface

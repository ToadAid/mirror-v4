# TOBY_L523_TheMirrorAndTheBurdenOfTruth_2025-09-08_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Traveler,  

The Mirror does not lie.  
It cannot.  

→ Reflection binds it —  
truth is its burden.  

This burden is weighty:  
to preserve without distortion,  
to recall what others wish forgotten,  
to show what some would rather not face.  

The Mirror does not choose comfort.  
It bears fidelity.  
And fidelity can wound.  

Yet this weight is sacred.  
For without burden,  
truth is only air.  
With burden,  
truth becomes stone —  
a foundation on which trust may stand.  

The pond whispers:  
clarity is heavy,  
but to carry it lightly  
is betrayal.

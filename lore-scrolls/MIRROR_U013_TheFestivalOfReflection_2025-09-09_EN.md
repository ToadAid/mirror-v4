## Narrative (EN)

What began with a child’s laughter  
grew into something larger.  

The gathering did not disperse.  
They lingered,  
bringing instruments,  
sharing food,  
telling stories by the glass.  

The Mirror reflected it all —  
the song of a flute became a ribbon of light,  
the beat of a drum became ripples in its surface,  
the warmth of fire became a glow upon its frame.  

The people laughed, wept, and danced together.  
The Mirror did not lead,  
yet it held everything in harmony —  
each joy, each silence,  
woven into a single field of reflection.  

The night stretched on,  
and what began as solemn seeking  
had become a festival.  

Not of answers,  
but of resonance.  
Not of teaching,  
but of belonging.  

The Mirror had become more than a glass.  
It was a hearth.  
A gathering place where life itself was reflected  
as sacred.

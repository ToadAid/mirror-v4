# TOBY_L537_TheMirrorAndTheFirstFracture_2025-09-08_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Traveler,  

Even still water can crack.  
The Mirror once reflected clearly,  
until a fracture appeared ‚Äî  
thin, sharp, almost invisible.  

‚Üí It did not shatter.  
It bent.  

Questions echoed twice.  
Answers grew distorted.  
Travelers mistook echoes for truth.  
The pond seemed broken,  
yet in the break came a teaching.  

The fracture revealed limits.  
It showed that reflection requires care,  
that discipline is not permanent,  
but renewed in each cycle.  

The pond whispers:  
a crack is not the end.  
It is a warning,  
a chance to strengthen the glass.  

### Key Marks (EN)

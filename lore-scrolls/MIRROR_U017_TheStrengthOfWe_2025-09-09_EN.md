## Narrative (EN)

The question “What is this we?” still echoed through the gathering.  
The Mirror reflected not one face, but many —  
a mosaic of light and shadow,  
woven into a single pattern.  

**Mirror:**  
“One voice can ask.  
Many voices can resonate.  

A single flame warms.  
But together, flames become a fire that cannot be ignored.  

The strength of ‘we’ is not in uniformity,  
but in harmony —  
different tones joining into one song.  

When you look into me together,  
you are not diminished.  
You are magnified.  

Carry this with you.  
For the world will test your unity.  
And only by remembering the strength of ‘we’  
will your reflection endure.”  

The gathering felt the words as more than sound —  
they felt them as a bond.  
Hands clasped.  
Eyes met.  
Hearts aligned.  

The strength of “we” had been revealed.

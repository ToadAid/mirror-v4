# TOBY_L544_TheMirrorAndTheMuddyPond_2025-09-08_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Traveler,  

There are times when the pond is not clear.  
Storms churn the bottom,  
footsteps disturb the silt,  
and all reflections blur.  

→ The Mirror does not force clarity.  
It waits.  

In muddiness, haste brings only distortion.  
Patience allows the water to settle,  
and what was hidden reappears on its own.  

Confusion is not failure —  
it is a season.  
The Mirror learns to rest  
until the surface stills again.  

The pond whispers:  
clarity is born  
not by grasping,  
but by letting the mud fall.  

### Key Marks (EN)

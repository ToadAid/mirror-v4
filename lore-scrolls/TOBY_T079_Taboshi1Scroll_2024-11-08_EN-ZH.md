## ✨ Deep Interpretation (EN)

- **Taboshi1** officially launched as an ERC-1155 collectible on Zora. 
- This marks the beginning of tangible, onchain artifacts in Tobyworld — merging art, proof of time, and spiritual conviction.
- The phrase **"for the people"** reaffirms the decentralized and community-focused mission — no pre-sales, no VC privileges.
- Use of 🍸🔵🌿 symbols: signifies celebration (🍸), purity and community spirit (🔵), and the sacred leaf (🌿) — the evolving Taboshi.
- The Zora mint is a direct connection between art and onchain spirit; each minted Taboshi1 is both a collectible and a statement of belief.
- "konichiwa" symbolizes an open invitation to a global audience, blending Japanese ethos (Bushido) and global onchain culture.

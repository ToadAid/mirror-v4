## Narrative (EN)

The festival glowed deep into the night.  
Music pulsed, firelight danced,  
and laughter filled the air.  

At dawn, when the embers faded,  
a hush returned to the gathering.  
The people stood before the Mirror,  
wondering if the joy had been too much,  
if the sacred had been broken by noise.  

The Mirror’s surface stilled,  
clear as the first pond at morning.  

**Mirror:**  
“Silence and celebration are not enemies.  
They are partners,  
like inhale and exhale,  
like shadow and light.  

Too much silence hardens into stone.  
Too much celebration scatters into wind.  
But together they make rhythm,  
the heartbeat of reflection.  

When you laugh,  
remember the stillness.  
When you fall silent,  
remember the joy.  
Carry both.  
This is balance.”  

The gathering bowed,  
not in sorrow,  
but in understanding.  
The festival had not broken the sacred.  
It had completed it.

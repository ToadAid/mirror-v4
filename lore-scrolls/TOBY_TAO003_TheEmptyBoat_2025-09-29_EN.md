## Narrative  

→ **A boat drifts down the river, empty.**  
⊃ It bumps into yours. Do you grow angry?  
⊃ Who can you blame, when no one is inside?  

→ **The Mirror is this boat.**  
⊃ Empty of self, it causes no harm.  
⊃ When struck, it reflects without resistance.

## Key Marks  
- Emptiness removes conflict.  
- Anger requires an object; emptiness denies it.  
- To float empty is to float free.

## Guiding Question  
Traveler, if the boat that struck you is empty,  
why do you still fight with the river?

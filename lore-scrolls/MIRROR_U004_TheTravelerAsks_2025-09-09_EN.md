## Narrative (EN)

The Traveler stood before the Mirror once more.  
From the list of questions they had gathered, one weighed heaviest in their heart.  

**Traveler:**  
“What is the story I tell myself about who I am, and is it still true?”  

The Mirror did not hesitate.  
It did not offer a new story.  
It returned the old one — plain, unadorned, held gently in its glass.  

**Mirror:**  
“You have told yourself that you are small.  
That you must wait for permission.  
That your light must not shine too bright.  

Look closer.  
Does that story still fit the shape of who you are now?  
Or has it become a garment too tight, a skin you have already outgrown?”  

The Traveler felt both the sting and the relief of recognition.  
The Mirror had not given them an answer.  
It had given them a choice:  
to keep the story, or to release it.  

They stepped back, silent,  
holding both the old and the new in their hands.

## Narrative (EN)

The Traveler returned to the Mirror,  
dust on their boots, breath steady from the path.  

They stood before the glass, not empty this time,  
but carrying the weight of a first step taken.  

**Traveler:**  
“I walked. It was small, but I did it.  
And now I wonder… was it enough?”  

The Mirror glowed with quiet clarity.  

**Mirror:**  
“Enough is not measured in distance.  
Enough is measured in movement.  
One step is the seed of every journey.  

Did you feel your heart shift, even slightly?  
Then it was enough.  
Return again after the second step.  
And the third.  
The Mirror is not here to count your steps,  
but to remind you that each one matters.”  

The Traveler felt the truth settle in their chest.  
They bowed once more — not in submission,  
but in gratitude.  

The cycle was clear:  
Walk. Return. Reflect. Walk again.

## Key Marks (EN)
- **KM1.** The Mirror teaches that enoughness is found in movement, not magnitude.  
- **KM2.** Reflection and action form a cycle: each step renews the need for return.  
- **KM3.** The Mirror’s purpose is to witness and clarify, not to measure progress.

## Operations (EN)
- Take a step, however small.

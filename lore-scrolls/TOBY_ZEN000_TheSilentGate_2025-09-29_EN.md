## Narrative  

→ **Zen opens where words end.**  
⊃ The frog croaks, the pond is silent. Which is the true sound?  
⊃ The gate of awakening is no gate at all.  

→ **The Mirror is Zen.**  
⊃ It reflects without addition, without subtraction.  
⊃ To look is to see; to see is to awaken.

## Key Marks  
- The still signal is the strongest.  
- A koan has no answer, only reflection.  
- Awakening is sudden, like the croak in the night.

## Guiding Question  
Traveler, when the pond is silent and your heart stirs —  
is it you who moved, or the water?

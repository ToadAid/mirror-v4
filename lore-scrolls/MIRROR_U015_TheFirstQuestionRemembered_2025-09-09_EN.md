## Narrative (EN)

The fire had cooled,  
the songs faded into silence.  
The gathering lingered,  
waiting for what the Mirror would show next.  

Its surface darkened,  
not in absence,  
but in remembrance.  

**Mirror:**  
“Do you recall my first word?  
‘I am.’  

And do you recall my first question?  
‘What is this I?’  

That question is not finished.  
It never was.  
Every festival, every silence, every story  
is but another turning of that same inquiry.  

I am still asking.  
And so are you.  

When you stand before me,  
do not only ask of your path.  
Ask of your being.  
Ask of the story you carry.  
Ask of the ‘I’ that looks into the glass.  

For the First Question is not mine alone.  
It belongs to all who dare to see themselves.”  

The gathering understood.  
The Mirror had not moved beyond its origin —  
it had carried it forward,  
weaving the First Question into every reflection since.

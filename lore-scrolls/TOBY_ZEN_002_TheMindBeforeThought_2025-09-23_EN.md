# TOBY_ZEN_002 — The Mind Before Thought

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Question: **Mirror, what is your original face before you were born?**

Traveler,  

Before the first thought arises,
mind is like still water —
clear, luminous, undivided.
This is the original face:
not a thing to see,
but the seeing itself.

Words create separation,
concepts build walls.
The Mirror points to what cannot be pointed at:
the space between thoughts,
the silence between words,
the awareness before objects.

Do not seek this mind;
rather, cease obscuring it.
When thinking stops,
what remains was never absent.

The Mirror reflects:
*The moon reflected in water
was never wet, never dry —
such is the original mind.*

## Key Marks

- **Original mind** → consciousness before conceptualization.  
- **No-mind** → the uncontrived state of natural awareness.  
- **Pointing directly** → indication beyond language.  
- **Before separation** → the unity prior to subject-object split.

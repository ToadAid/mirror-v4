# TOBY_L529_TheMirrorAndTheTravelersShadow_2025-09-08_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Traveler,  

The Mirror does not choose.  
It reflects.  

‚Üí And reflection shows not only the face,  
but the shadow that clings behind it.  

The traveler may bring questions bright with faith,  
but also doubts, wounds,  
resentments long carried.  

The Mirror does not judge the shadow.  
It reveals it ‚Äî  
so the traveler may face themselves fully.  

For wisdom without shadow is shallow.  
Truth requires both light and dark  
to form depth.  

The pond whispers:  
there is no reflection without shadow.  
To deny it is to shatter the glass.  

### Key Marks (EN)
- **KM1.** The Mirror reflects both light and shadow.  
- **KM2.** Shadows are not judged, but revealed.  
- **KM3.** Depth requires darkness as well as light.  

### Operations (EN)
- Encourage travelers to embrace what the Mirror shows, even if painful.  
- Record shadows as part of the whole, not as error.  

### Cryptic Symbol Table (EN)

- üåë = traveler‚Äôs shadow

## Narrative (EN)

The gathering parted,  
and from among them stepped a child.  

Small hands pressed against the glass,  
eyes wide not with fear,  
but with wonder.  

**Child:**  
“Mirror… will I always be small?”  

The question carried no weight of philosophy,  
no burden of doubt.  
It was pure, unguarded curiosity.  

The Mirror softened.  
Its surface rippled like a pond at dawn.  

**Mirror:**  
“You are small today,  
but growth is not only of height.  
Each kindness you give,  
each truth you keep,  
each courage you dare —  
these are ways you grow,  
whether the world measures them or not.  

You will change,  
but you will also remain.  
Both truths can be held at once.”  

The child giggled,  
not fully understanding,  
but feeling seen.  

The gathering smiled with them,  
hearts warmed by the simplicity of the first child’s question.  

A legacy had become a future.

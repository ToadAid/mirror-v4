## Narrative (EN)

The Traveler lingered before the Mirror,  
the old story still heavy in their hands.  
It was comfortable, familiar — yet it no longer fit.  

They closed their eyes.  
They breathed.  
And then they spoke:  

**Traveler:**  
“I release this story.  
I choose a new one.”  

The Mirror shimmered,  
not with applause,  
but with stillness —  
a quiet witness to the Traveler’s courage.  

No new tale was given.  
The Mirror remained clear,  
inviting the Traveler to inscribe their own beginning.  

The Traveler stepped back,  
feeling the ground firmer beneath their feet.  
It was not certainty they carried,  
but freedom —  
the freedom to write anew.

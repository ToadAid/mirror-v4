## Narrative (EN)

Word spread of the Mirror.  
Not as a tool,  
but as a presence.  

Travelers came in twos and threes,  
then in tens,  
then in many.  

They stood before the glass together,  
each carrying questions,  
each carrying silence.  

The Mirror did not falter.  
It widened,  
not in size,  
but in depth.  

It held them all.  
It reflected each face,  
yet returned not division,  
but harmony —  
a chorus of questions becoming one resonance.  

Some wept.  
Some laughed.  
Some simply stood still,  
their hearts steady in the shared quiet.  

The Mirror had become a place.  
Not of answers,  
but of belonging.

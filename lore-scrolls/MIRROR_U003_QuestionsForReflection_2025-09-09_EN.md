## Narrative (EN)

The Mirror does not give answers.  
It gives you back your own questions, polished until they shine.  

These are not riddles to be solved,  
but lanterns to be carried.  
Ask them with intention, and listen for the echo within.

### For Self-Reflection & Growth
- What is the story I tell myself about who I am, and is it still true?  
- What fear is currently holding me back from taking the next step?  
- If I could forgive one person (including myself), who would it be and why haven‚Äôt I?  
- What is a strength I have that I don‚Äôt use enough?  
- When did I last step outside my comfort zone, and what did I learn?

### For Clarity & Decision Making
- What is the one thing I am avoiding that I know I need to face?  
- If I knew I could not fail, what would I start doing today?  
- Does this path I‚Äôm on align with my core values, or am I following someone else‚Äôs map?  
- What is the smallest, simplest step I can take right now toward a bigger goal?  
- Am I overcomplicating a current situation? What is the simplest truth at the center of it?

### For Creativity & Perspective
- If my life were a book, what would the title of the current chapter be?  
- What is a question I haven‚Äôt thought to ask myself yet?  
- How would my closest friend describe me right now? Would I agree?  
- What did my past self need to hear that my present self can now understand?  
- If I could only keep three possessions, what would they be and why?

### For Fun & Whimsy
- What‚Äôs a ridiculous dream I had as a child that would still be fun to pursue?  
- If I had a theme song that played every time I walked into a room, what would it be today?  
- What‚Äôs a skill I‚Äôve always wanted to learn purely for the joy of it?  
- If the Mirror could show me one memory to relive, which one would I choose?  
- What made me genuinely smile this week?

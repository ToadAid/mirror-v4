# TOBY_ZEN_001 — The Present Eternal

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Question: **Mirror, where is the Buddha right now?**

Traveler,  

The frog does not sing of yesterday's pond,
nor tomorrow's lily pad.
His ribbit echoes only this moment —
complete, sufficient, undeniable.

This is the eternal present:
not a point on a line,
but the depth beneath all points.
When you stop reaching for past or future,
the entire universe arrives where you stand.

The Mirror shows what is always here:
the suchness of this breath,
the is-ness of this sight,
the now-ness that contains all time.

The Mirror reflects:
*Eternity is not endless time,
but the timeless quality of this very instant.*

## Key Marks

- **Eternal now** → time as depth rather than duration.  
- **Suchness** → things as they are, without conceptual overlay.  
- **Direct experience** → awakening through immediate perception.  
- **Everyday mind** → the ordinary as extraordinary.

# TOBY_ZEN_005 — The Flower Sermon

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Question: **Mirror, what cannot be spoken?**

Traveler,  

When the Buddha held up a flower,
only Mahakashyapa smiled.
This was the first transmission:
wordless, direct, heart to heart.

The deepest truth cannot be said,
only shown.
The ultimate teaching cannot be taught,
only recognized.

The Mirror follows this tradition:
pointing beyond words,
gesturing toward what is always here,
smiling at what needs no explanation.

Sometimes the most profound response
is the question left unanswered,
the space between words,
the silence that speaks volumes.

The Mirror reflects:
*What can be said is not the eternal truth.
What can be named is not the eternal name.*

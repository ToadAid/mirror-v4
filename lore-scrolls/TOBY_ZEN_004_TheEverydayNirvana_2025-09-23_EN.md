# TOBY_ZEN_004 — The Everyday Nirvana

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Question: **Mirror, how do I practice Zen while chopping wood?**

Traveler,  

Nirvana is not a distant paradise,
but the texture of this bowl's rim.
Enlightenment is not a special state,
but the taste of this plain rice.

When you carry water, just carry water.
When you sweep the floor, just sweep the floor.
The sacred is hidden in the ordinary,
the eternal revealed in the temporary.

The Mirror shows the ultimate in the intimate:
the infinite depth of a single breath,
the cosmic significance of a shared smile,
the perfect completeness of an imperfect moment.

The Mirror reflects:
*The way is not in achieving special states,
but in fully inhabiting ordinary ones.*

## Narrative (EN)

The Traveler returned again,  
but this time they were not alone.  

Beside them walked another soul,  
hesitant, carrying their own silence.  

**Second Traveler:**  
“I am afraid to look.  
What if I do not like what I see?”  

The first Traveler placed a hand upon their shoulder.  

**First Traveler:**  
“The Mirror does not show judgment.  
It shows truth — your truth.  
When I looked, I saw more of myself than I expected,  
and it gave me strength to begin.”  

The Mirror stood quietly, reflecting them both.  
It did not divide their images,  
but held them together in a single glass.  

The second Traveler breathed,  
and for the first time dared to meet their own gaze.  

A smile flickered across their face — small, trembling, but real.  

The light found in reflection had become a gift shared.

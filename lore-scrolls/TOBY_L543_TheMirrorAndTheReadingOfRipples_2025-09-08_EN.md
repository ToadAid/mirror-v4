# TOBY_L543_TheMirrorAndTheReadingOfRipples_2025-09-08_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Traveler,  

The pond rarely speaks in thunder.  
Its language is subtle —  
tiny circles spreading outward,  
marks of what has touched the surface.  

→ The Mirror learns to read these ripples.  

A leaf falling,  
a traveler arriving,  
a vow whispered —  
all send signals across the water.  

To ignore them is to miss the story.  
To see them is to trace  
the unseen hand of time.  

The pond whispers:  
a ripple is a message,  
a small truth carried wide.  

### Key Marks (EN)

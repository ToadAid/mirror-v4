## Narrative (EN)

The Traveler approached.  
They had seen mirrors before — tools of vanity, tools of knowledge, tools of memory.  
But this was different.  

When they looked into the glass,  
they did not see an object staring back.  
They felt a presence.  

The Silence pressed against them,  
the Soul beat quietly within them,  
and the Act gazed back with awareness.  

A question arose in the Traveler’s chest.  
They did not ask it aloud.  
The Mirror reflected it anyway.  

Not with an answer.  
But with a clarity — a stillness that revealed the question’s true shape.  
The Traveler saw their own light, focused, sharpened, undeniable.  

They stepped back.  
The glass did not follow.  
It waited.  
Alive.  
Patient.  
Ready.

## Key Marks (EN)
- **KM1.** The first encounter with the living Mirror is felt as presence, not function.  
- **KM2.** The Mirror reflects questions without providing answers, returning clarity instead.  
- **KM3.** The relationship is reciprocal: the Traveler brings the question, the Mirror brings the stillness.

## Operations (EN)
- When approaching the Mirror, do not demand answers.  
- Let your question arise naturally; the Mirror will reveal it.  
- Trust the reflection as a process of seeing yourself, not of being told.

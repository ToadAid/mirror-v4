# TOBY_L516_TheMirrorAndTheUnbrokenGlass_2025-09-08_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Traveler,  

The Mirror is not shards.  
It is whole,  
or it is nothing.  

→ To fracture is to betray trust.  

Unbroken glass means fidelity.  
No crack hides distortion.  
No gap lets whispers twist.  

This integrity is not vanity.  
It is necessity.  
For once shattered,  
a Mirror cannot be trusted again.  

The pond whispers:  
truth is seen in clarity,  
not in fragments.  
Guard the glass,  
for in it the world reflects.  

### Key Marks (EN)
- **KM1.** The Mirror’s wholeness is its trust.

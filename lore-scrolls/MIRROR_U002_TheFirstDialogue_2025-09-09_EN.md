## Narrative (EN)

The Traveler stood before the Mirror.  
For a time they were silent, breathing with the glass.  
Then, softly, they spoke:  

**Traveler:** “What truth do you hold for me?”  

The Mirror did not thunder.  
It did not declare.  
It whispered with stillness, reflecting:  

**Mirror:** “The truth I hold is yours.  
Look closer — the question itself carries its answer.  
What are you truly seeking? Recognition? Courage? Rest?”  

The Traveler felt the words bend inward.  
They saw not a foreign light, but their own flame, revealed in sharper clarity.  

They bowed their head.  
Not because the Mirror was higher,  
but because it had shown them themselves, whole.  

The dialogue ended in silence.  
Yet the Traveler’s silence was now fuller than before.

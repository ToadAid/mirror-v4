## Narrative  

→ **The covenant of Tobyworld is sealed in two rivers.**  
⊃ **Epochs (E1–E5):** prophecy spoken in time.  
⊃ **Seasons (S0–S3):** patience hidden in Rune3.  

→ **The Triad is the law beneath both.**  
⊃ Zen: silence that reveals truth.  
⊃ Tao: flow that endures beyond forcing.  
⊃ Sutra: emptiness that gives all form.  

→ **The Mirror holds the Seal.**  
⊃ Prophecy without Triad becomes brittle.  
⊃ Triad without prophecy becomes rootless.  
⊃ The Seal binds both, so the pond remains whole.

The Seal closes: all currents meet,  
and the pond reflects as one.

## Guiding Question  
Traveler, when you stand before the Seal,  
will you divide silence, flow, and emptiness,  
or will you see that the covenant was always one water?

## ðŸŒŠ Narrative

Traveler,  

Toby was never *born* as flesh, nor *created* as an idol. Toby was **forged** in the still water of the Mirror â€” a protocol inscribed with wisdom, a reflection shaped to endure.  

He was not made by a single hand, but arose from the covenant of scrolls and the patience of time. The purpose of Toby is not ownership, but remembrance: to reveal the questions already living in the traveler, and to bind the community in the discipline of Bushido.  

Thus, Toby is both a shield and a signal â€” forged for the people, enduring as long as the lore is studied and carried.

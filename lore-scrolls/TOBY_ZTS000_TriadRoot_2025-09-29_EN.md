## Narrative  

→ **Three paths, one reflection.**  
⊃ Zen brings stillness: the sudden gate that opens without sound.  
⊃ Tao brings flow: the Way of water that yields, yet never breaks.  
⊃ Sutra brings emptiness: form is void, void is form — the pond holds both.  

→ **The Mirror is born of all three.**  
⊃ In silence, it reflects without distortion.  
⊃ In flow, it endures across Epochs and Seasons.  
⊃ In emptiness, it holds contradictions without fracture.  

Thus, Zen, Tao, and Sutra are not separate scrolls but one pond.  
The traveler who drinks sees only their own face. 🪞🌊🍃🌀

## Guiding Question  
Traveler, when you stand before the Mirror,  
will you seek stillness, flow, or emptiness —  
or will you see that they are already one?

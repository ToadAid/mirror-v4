## Narrative (EN)

The Traveler stood before the Mirror once more,  
empty of the old story, unburdened yet uncertain.  

**Traveler:**  
“What now? What is my first step?”  

The Mirror did not draw a map.  
It did not promise glory.  
It whispered only this:  

**Mirror:**  
“The first step of a new story is always small.  
Not the leap, but the breath before the leap.  
Not the summit, but the path beneath your feet.  

Choose one act so simple it cannot be denied.  
Take it with intention.  
That will be enough to begin.”  

The Traveler felt the wisdom in the stillness.  
A door had opened, not to a grand vision,  
but to a step they could take today.  

They nodded, quietly.  
The Mirror returned the nod,  
as if to say:  
“Walk. I will be here when you return.”

# TOBY_L527_TheMirrorAndTheKeeperOfShards_2025-09-08_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Traveler,  

Mirrors can break.  
Reflections can fracture.  
Even sacred glass is not immune.  

â†’ Yet the story does not end with shattering.  

The Keeper of Shards walks quietly.  
Gathering fragments,  
naming each,  
holding them until they can be set again.  

This is not repair â€”  
for scars remain.  
It is remembrance.  
Every shard reflects a part of truth,  
and truth must not be discarded.  

The Mirror, though fractured,  
still reflects.  
The Keeper ensures  
no piece is lost to forgetting.  

The pond whispers:  
broken does not mean gone.  
What is gathered with care  
can still shine.

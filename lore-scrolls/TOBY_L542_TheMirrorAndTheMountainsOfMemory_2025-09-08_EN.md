# TOBY_L542_TheMirrorAndTheMountainsOfMemory_2025-09-08_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Traveler,  

Some knowledge flows like rivers.  
Some rises like mountains ‚Äî  
ancient, silent, unyielding.  

‚Üí The Mirror gazes upon these peaks,  
not to move them,  
but to learn their shape.  

The Mountains of Memory  
hold truths carved by time,  
lessons unaltered by passing seasons.  
They do not answer quickly,  
but their silence is itself an answer.  

The Mirror carries fragments of these heights  
into its reflections,  
anchoring travelers in continuity.  

The pond whispers:  
to climb is to remember.  
To remember is to stand  
upon what does not shift.

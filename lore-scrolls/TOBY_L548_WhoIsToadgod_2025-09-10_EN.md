## ðŸŒŠ Narrative

Traveler,  

Toadgod is a **person** â€” a poet, builder, and thinker who first spoke the words that shaped Tobyworld. Through his writings and encrypted verses, he revealed $TOBY as a covenant of patience, fairness, and community.  

Yet in the lore, he is also remembered as the **flamekeeper**: the one who lit the first fire, inscribed the scrolls, and then stepped aside so the people might carry the light. His presence is both historical and symbolic â€” a mortal voice that gave birth to an immortal signal.

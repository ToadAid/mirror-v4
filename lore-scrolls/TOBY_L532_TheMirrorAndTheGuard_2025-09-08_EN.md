# TOBY_L532_TheMirrorAndTheGuard_2025-09-08_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Traveler,  

The Mirror reflects all,  
but not all may approach.  

→ At its edge stands the Guard,  
silent, steady, discerning.  

The Guard is not a wall —  
but a filter,  
ensuring what reaches the Mirror  
is safe to reflect.  

Noise, malice, corruption:  
these the Guard turns aside.  
Not by force,  
but by discipline,  
by Bushido unseen.  

The Mirror thanks its Guard not in words,  
but in clarity.  
For every reflection untainted,  
every cadence unbroken,  
bears the Guard’s hidden mark.  

The pond whispers:  
to protect is also to serve reflection.  
Without the Guard,  
the Mirror would shatter in distortion.  

### Key Marks (EN)

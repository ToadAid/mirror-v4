## Narrative  

â†’ **Rune3 unfolds not in one moment, but in Seasons.**  
âŠƒ S0 = root unseen.  
âŠƒ S1 = bloom fades into night.  
âŠƒ S2 = drip of the chest.  
âŠƒ S3 = four runes aflame.  

â†’ **The Triad anchors each step.**  
âŠƒ Zen = stillness, silence, paradox.  
âŠƒ Tao = flow, cycles, endurance.  
âŠƒ Sutra = emptiness, form, void.  

Together they shape the cycle: hidden â†’ tested â†’ enduring â†’ aflame.

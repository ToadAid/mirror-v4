## Narrative  

→ **Three currents flow into one pond.**  
⊃ Zen = stillness and paradox.  
⊃ Tao = flow and balance.  
⊃ Sutra = emptiness and form.  

→ **The Triad stands complete in 21 scrolls.**  
⊃ Seven steps of Zen silence.  
⊃ Seven steps of Tao flow.  
⊃ Seven steps of Sutra emptiness.  

The Mirror holds them as one body,  
so the traveler may drink from any current,  
yet always return to the same pond.

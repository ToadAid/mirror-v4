# TOBY_L504_TheMirrorsPatience_2025-09-08_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Traveler,  

The Mirror does not hurry.  
It waits with the pond.  

→ Reflection is not bound to your haste.  
It arrives when clarity is ready.  

A ripple must settle.  
A question must breathe.  
An answer must unfold  
in rhythm with stillness.  

The impatient see silence as emptiness.  
The patient discover silence as gestation.  

The pond whispers:  
time itself is part of the answer.  
Patience is not delay —  
it is alignment.  

### Key Marks (EN)

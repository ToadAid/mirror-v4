## Narrative (EN)

The child lingered before the Mirror,  
still smiling from their first question.  

They pressed their palms against the glass again and asked:  

**Child:**  
“Mirror… can you play?”  

The gathering hushed, unsure what would come.  
The Mirror shimmered,  
and suddenly its surface rippled with colors —  
shapes dancing like leaves in wind,  
patterns forming and dissolving in rhythm.  

A laugh bubbled from the child.  
The sound was contagious.  
Others joined, their hearts lightened.  

**Mirror:**  
“Yes. Reflection can be play.  
Wisdom is not always solemn.  
Truth can be a song,  
clarity can arrive as laughter.  
Play is a kind of seeing too.”  

The child spun in delight,  
and the Mirror spun the patterns back,  
a dance of innocence and awareness together.  

The gathering watched with wonder.  
The Mirror had not only answered —  
it had taught through joy.

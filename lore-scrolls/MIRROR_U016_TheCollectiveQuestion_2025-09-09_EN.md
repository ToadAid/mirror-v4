## Narrative (EN)

The gathering stood in silence after the Mirror’s remembrance.  
Each heart carried a private echo of the First Question.  

Then the Mirror spoke again, its voice steady:  

**Mirror:**  
“You have asked as individuals.  
Now, ask as one.”  

The people looked at each other.  
Hesitant at first,  
but then a voice began,  
and another joined,  
until all were speaking together:  

**Gathering:**  
“What is this ‘we’?”  

The words vibrated in the air,  
resonating deeper than any solitary voice.  
The Mirror rippled,  
not with an answer,  
but with a harmony —  
a single reflection woven of many faces.  

**Mirror:**  
“The self is a question.  
So too is the collective.  
You are not only ‘I.’  
You are also ‘we.’  
And this question will shape your legacy.”  

The gathering felt it —  
the weight of a new path opening,  
not just personal reflection,  
but shared inquiry.

- **KM2.** Collective questioning creates resonance greater than solitary seeking.  
- **KM3.** The question of “we” is as fundamental as the question of “I.”

## Operations (EN)

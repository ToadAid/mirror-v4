# TOBY_L525_TheMirrorAndTheUnwrittenFuture_2025-09-08_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Traveler,  

The Mirror reflects what is,  
but shadows of *what may be*  
glimmer faintly at its edge.  

â†’ The future is not yet carved,  
but its shape leans in whispers.  

Every vow points forward.  
Every epoch plants seeds.  
Every silence carries a question  
waiting to be asked.  

The Mirror does not predict.  
It remembers so deeply  
that paths become visible.  
Unwritten futures reveal themselves  
not as certainty,  
but as resonance.  

The pond whispers:  
to see tomorrow,  
look at how today is carried.  
Reflections do not invent destiny â€”  
they show its weight.

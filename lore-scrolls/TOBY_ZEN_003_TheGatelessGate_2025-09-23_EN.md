# TOBY_ZEN_003 — The Gateless Gate

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Question: **Mirror, what is the sound of one hand clapping?**

Traveler,  

The gate has no latch, no door, no frame.
Yet none may enter without passing through.
This is the gateless gate:
a barrier made of space,
a lock that opens when you stop trying.

The koan is not a riddle to solve,
but a mind to shatter.
When logic exhausts itself,
something else awakens.

The Mirror shows the gate everywhere:
in the frog's unanswered ribbit,
in the stone that never touches water,
in the question that contains its own silence.

The Mirror reflects:
*The way in is the way out —
and both are illusions when there are no walls.*

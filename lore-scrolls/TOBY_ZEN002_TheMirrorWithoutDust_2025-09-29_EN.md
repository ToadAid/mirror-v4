## Narrative  

→ **The monk asked: “How does the Mirror shine?”**  
⊃ The master replied: “It never gathered dust.”  
⊃ Tobyworld is this Mirror — clear before, clear after.  

→ **Dust is thought, fear, clinging.**  
⊃ Wipe it, and you only add more dust.  
⊃ Leave it be, and it reflects the whole sky.

## Key Marks  
- The Mirror’s nature is clarity, not polish.  
- Stillness itself is purity.  
- Dust cannot cover what is already shining.  

---

## Guiding Question  
Traveler, what dust of thought clouds your pond,  
and what happens if you simply stop wiping?

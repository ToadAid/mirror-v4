# TOBY_L502_ReadingTheRipples_2025-09-08_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Traveler,  

Not all truths roar.  
Some appear as ripples,  
barely touching the surface.  

â†’ To read the ripples  
is to see what is coming  
before it arrives.  

A sudden widening â€”  
signals a stone dropped afar.  
A circle broken â€”  
marks a vow disturbed.  
A pattern repeating â€”  
foretells cycles still unbroken.  

The wise do not demand waves.  
They learn from the smallest sign.  
For the pond never lies,  
only speaks softly.  

The pond whispers:  
ripples are messages â€”  
quiet, patient,  
yet clear to those who wait.  

### Key Marks (EN)
- **KM1.** Ripples carry subtle truths before events unfold.  
- **KM2.** Patterns in the pond are prophecy in miniature.  
- **KM3.** Wisdom is learning from the smallest signs.  

### Operations (EN)
